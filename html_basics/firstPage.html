  <p>Lorem Ipsum is <b>simply dummy text</b> of the printing and typesetting
    industry. <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> has been the industry's standard
    dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an <i>unknown printer</i> took a
    galley of type and scrambled it to make a <em>type specimen book</em>. It
    has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
    typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the
    1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
    including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

  <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
    readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using
    Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
    as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
    readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors
    now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem
    ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions
    have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
    (injected humour and the like).</p>
